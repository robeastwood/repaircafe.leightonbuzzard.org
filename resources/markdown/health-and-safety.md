# Health and Safety Policy

## Mission Statement

Totally Leighton Buzzard and the Repair Caf√© Leighton Buzzard is committed to providing a safe repair cafe event.

This Health and Safety Policy demonstrates our commitment to our volunteers and visitors.

You should also refer to our Disclaimer and this should be signed and dated before any repair work is conducted.

## Introduction

### The Set-up

-   Extension leads must be taped to the floor (where possible) and kept out of the flow of foot traffic.

-   Check with the hosts of a Restart Party before soldering. Ventilation is an issue in some venues.

-   Hosts or the designated safety volunteer will locate and draw your attention to fire extinguishers and fire exits. If you miss this announcement, please inform yourself.

-   A first aider will be identified as such when present.

### Basics

-   Children must be accompanied at all times by their guardians and kept an appropriate distance from chemicals, soldering and dangerous tools.

-   When using blades or sharp instruments, always cut away from your body, and we recommend you use gloves.

-   Be mindful when opening a device or using any force as bits may go flying (into someone's eye). If this is a risk, ask for eye protection and/or move away from others.

-   Careful with drinks! Do not consume spillable drinks at repair tables.

### Electricity

-   If you have any doubts or questions, find the host who will call over a designated safety volunteer

-   All mains-operated devices must be PAT tested before you start a repair and on completion.

-   We do not repair a component of a device unless we are able to safety test the full device on the spot

-   Only repair mains equipment if you are competent to do so. To plug in a mains appliance, use an RCD or a dedicated mains isolating transformer. Use insulated tools.

-   Beware of stored high voltage in capacitors, even a very long time after a device has been disconnected from the mains. Always test if they are charged with a voltmeter. If they are charged and you are not experienced in discharging them do not progress with the repair.

-   Put the device back together before testing it under mains power. If you have to test device while it is both plugged in to the power network and dismantled, only do so with a second Restarter present.

-   If you smell burning immediately unplug at the power plug and then assess the problem with our designated safety volunteer.

-   Beware of rechargeable batteries. If shorted or abused, they can be toxic and a fire risk.

-   We usually do not repair power tools or high-wattage electricals. We can make exceptions, but they will be assigned by hosts to experienced volunteers. If in doubt, ask a host.

-   For any old electrical device, always check that the wiring in the mains plug is to good standards.

-   If a device has been shorting out electrical circuits, connect the device only after being certain you have found and corrected the problem.

### Using cans and chemicals

-   Keep them away from any flame or direct sunlight.

-   Do not spray flammable or volatile liquid on a live circuit or close to a soldering iron.

-   Keep chemicals such as solvents far away from other people, especially children.
